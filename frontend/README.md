# FailWise

FailWise is an analytics-focused web application that helps candidates understand **why they fail interview rounds** by tracking interview attempts, identifying recurring weak areas, and generating focused, data-driven improvement insights.

---

## 🎯 Who is FailWise for?

FailWise is designed for **freshers and early-career professionals** who attend multiple interviews but receive little to no structured feedback on their performance.

---

## ❓ Problem It Solves

Most interview preparation platforms focus on **practice content**, not on **failure analysis**.  
Candidates often fail repeatedly without understanding the root causes.

FailWise fills this gap by:
- capturing real interview outcomes
- analyzing failure patterns across topics and rounds
- surfacing actionable insights instead of generic advice

## 🧠 Core Concept: Interview Attempt

### Optional but Valuable Fields
- **Self-Score** — Candidate’s self-assessed performance score (1–10)
